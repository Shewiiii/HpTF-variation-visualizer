**This is a work in progress !** 

## Introduction
This is a small project to help visualize the headphone transfer function (HpTF) effects using measurements from the B&K 5128 HATS and GRAS system (KB50xx).
The Hptf delta between these two rigs, can be used to indicate **how much the frequency response is likely to vary from head to head**. Thus, the second plot indicates the region you may want to EQ if something does not sound right (in addition to the standard frequency response).  

If you notice any calculation error, please don't hesitate to open an issue ! Thank you in advance.
